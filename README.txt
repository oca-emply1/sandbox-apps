I believe the best way to prove that you have a particular expertise is by showcasing your expertise.									
I want to use this repository to store all the test apps I will be developing to showcase my expertise in app development.
I intend to focus on:
Java
Android
Swift / iOS
C# (by way of development in Unity3d)
Python
The full web-development suite --> Ruby/Rails  |  HTML5  |  CSS  |  JavaScript  | PHP
